    B-Trees was started in 2021 by <a href="http://brendancoates.net">Brendan Coates</a> 
    with the goal of restoring native plant and animal communities in Los Angeles,
    with a particular focus on helping tenants reclaim their outdoor space from landlords and from the city<br><br>
    B-Trees provides seeds, seedlings, and training to help tenants start native/ regionally appropriate
    gardens where they live<br><br>
    Among the many indignities of tenancy, of not having control over your housing, is that
    your own relationship with the land, the source of everything we'll ever need on this earth,
    becomes mediated by capitalist property relations. This has a host of side effects for tenants,
    from access to plant foods and medicines, to the widely reported mental health
    benefits of gardening<br><br>
    As global warming accelerates, it's becoming increasingly important to recognize the benefits of
    working with beings who have lived in our neighborhoods for millions of years. Our photosynthetic bretheren
    are magnificent community builders and we have much to learn from them<br><br>
